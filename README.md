# hello-world
This repository (my first ever) is for my learning of the GitHub flow, storing ideas and resources, and keeping it as my main repository (for now).

My name is Lingalithu, Linga for short. I'm currently a 14 year old online learner in Africa, learning to finally use GitHub.
I infact made my account last year at 13 as I was learning the basics of web dev (which I stopped), but never learned how to use Github. I just kept it as "something to do".
Since I've been having an interest technology for a while now, I realized this field is what I want to learn continuously, and use to improve things back home.
So, in this incredible development platform, I plan to see what I can build using this, AND (most importantly), learn from this digital sea of world-class information and projects.

Thanks for reading!
